             <h1>A Guide to the Journey in Northern Lights</h1>
             <p>Viewing the aurora borealis is one of the bucket list trip for many.
<b>Here are the tips for how to enjoy and make that dream a reality.</b>
<b>
    Get ready for your Aurora adventure with exciting activities and breathtaking sceneries.</b><br>
<p>
It’s important to keep in mind that while your trip’s main highlight is catching a glimpse of this phenomenon, it would be a waste of your winter sojourn to only pursue the aurora.
From magical pearly-white landscapes where snow crunches under your  boots, to fairy-tale ice hotels and surreal glass igloos from where you can watch the lights flicker in the heart of the night, to adventurous husky-sled rides in the midst of peaceful forests, to villages teeming with indigenous peoples, the northern countries boast plenty of good fun.
To get a real taste of Iceland during the Northern Lights season, Extreme Iceland’s Hroarsson suggests visitors try activities such as glacier hiking, snowmobiling, super-jeep action, ice cave visits and lava tube caving. Do note, however, you’ll require a valid driver’s license to drive a snowmobile.

<h2>Here are some tips to do when you are about to go to the Northern Lights</h2><br>
Keep in mind that seeing the northern lights does require the right timing, location and meteorological conditions as well as a good dose of patience and luck. Below are important tips to remember if you want to experience this natural phenomenon.<br>
<br>
    
    <b>Choose the Right Month</b><br>
The northern lights are visible mainly between October and March each year in the Nordic region.<br>
<br>
    <b>Check the Forecast</b><br>
Location means nothing if you don't have the right combo of solar activity and cloudless skies. We recommend checking the Iceland Met Office’s aurora forecast page.<br>

<b>Get Out of Town</b><br>
It goes without saying that you need dark nights, but it's also ideal to get away from the glare of city lights. A stay in the countryside or a guided tour into the wilderness will greatly improve your view to the sky.<br>

<b>Stay Up Late</b><br>
The peak time is 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. Some hotels in the countryside may offer a special "wake up" service if the lights come out<br>

<b>Be Patient</b><br>
The lights do not appear on any kind of schedule. You may have to wait a few hours, but most northern lights tours involve some kind of activity or refreshments to keep guests entertained and warm. Unfortunately, sightings can never be guaranteed.<br>

<b>Bundle up</b><br>
Thermal layers and insulated outerwear are essential. If you’re on a guided excursion, you will usually be provided with loaned coveralls and/or other warm garments. Remember: northern lights are created by the sun and the atmosphere, so sightings can never be guaranteed.<br>
    
    
   <h3> Learn how to photograph the Northern Lights</h3>
<p>For many travellers, capturing unique photos of the Northern Lights is a goal in itself. The good news is that you don’t have to be skilled photographers to snap aurora beauties.

According to Egorova, the essential equipment for photography lovers includes a digital camera that has a manual mode and interchangeable lenses as well as a sturdy tripod, a remote control release to make sure your photos are as sharp as possible, a wide-angle lens with high light sensitivity and spare batteries and memory cards. A flash light is also a must – the best pictures are taken as far from the light pollution as possible, so you will need an extra light to work with your camera; a headlight might also come in handy.

To capture beautiful shots, keep in mind that complete darkness is not a must to highlight the allure of the Northern Lights; actually, a certain glow over the horizon might enhance the uniqueness of the photographs. Some recommended timings are an hour before and after sunset as well as – ironically – during a full moon.

    The surrounding, stressed Hroarsson of Extreme Iceland, is essential to take good photos of the Northern Lights; the environment, to him, is more important than the lights themselves as the photographer can play with the composition to capture unique images.</p>
