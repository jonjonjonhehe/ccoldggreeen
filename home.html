          <h3>Iceland Times</h3>
            <p>Iceland's aurora borealis can be seen most frequently between September and April. When the nights are sufficiently dark to observe the aurora. Midwinter, when there are only 4-5 hours of sunshine in Iceland, offers countless opportunity to search for aurora borealis.</p>

         <div class="course-col">
          <h3>Canada Northern Lights</h3>
            <p>The Northwest Territories, where they are typically visible 240 nights a year, is the best place in Canada, if not the entire world, to view aurora borealis. Fall or winter are the ideal seasons (though summer is pretty good, too).</p>

          <h3>Northern Lights in Alaska</h3>
            <p>Despite being more difficult to observe during the Midnight Sun, the northern lights can be seen in all four seasons of the year. Between August and April, when less daylight results in darker night skies, is the greatest time to see the northern lights in Alaska.</p>

                  <p>Hi! what a nice thing to talk about. I've been to Canada for the third times and I always loved the feeling as if it was my first time to go there!. Right now I am building my own place in Yukon to probably make that as our fam rest house. Hoping for everyone to feel  the same joyous feeling wevall could ever have when we go there! </p>
